relative to the project as of this date (latest commit 974436a on Jun 14 2020).

Changed
-------
* Renamed key ``state`` to ``subd`` as it contains state, province, region, etc.
* Converted to CSV format, roughly halving the file size
* Test for data integrity before publishing
* Created Python package for easy inclusion in Python projects and `published it to PyPi
  <https://pypi.org/project/airportsdata/>`__
* Fixed ``iata`` key so it is always of string type (converted existing ``'0'`` and ``Null`` to ``''``)
* Removed duplicate IATA entries for GOI, PDG and VNS (now only in VOGO, WIEE and VEBN respectively)
* Changed ``tz`` from ``'Maldives'`` to ``'Indian/Maldives'`` per IANA standard
* Changed non-standard ``country`` ``'KS'`` to ``'XK'`` as per https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:RS

  data (obtained by third-parties). https://github.com/mwgg/Airports/pull/40
* CZBF/ZBF province fix: The province for CZBF does not contain a dash (New Brunswick). Removal of dash to match the
